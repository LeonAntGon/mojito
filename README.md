Mojito is a visually engaging cocktail menu web app built with React, GSAP, and Tailwind CSS üç∏

The project was created as an exploration into modern web animation techniques, with a focus on enhancing user experience through smooth, scroll-driven motion and interactive transitions.

Using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), I implemented staggered animations, scroll-triggered sequences, masked image reveals, and dynamic content changes ‚Äî all fully responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS.

Mojito allowed me to deepen my understanding of animation principles in frontend development while building a clean, component-based interface that combines design and motion.
